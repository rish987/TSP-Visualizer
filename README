DESCRIPTION:

    This program can be used to visualize various methods that can be used to
    find optimized solutions to the TSP. The controls are as follows:
        p - replay
        r - play new, randomized tour
        a - toggle rank display mode
        d - delete location under cursor
        c - delete all locations 
        l - place location under cursor
        - click on a location to start a tour from that location

    Green location(s): ideal starting location(s) for the greedy algorithm.

    The current supported algorithms are:
    - greedy algorithm
